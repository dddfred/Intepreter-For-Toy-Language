# Intepreter-For-Toy-Language Fall/2022
Java based project in which I had to come up with an interpreter for a toy language

# WHAT I LEARNED
I learned how to make a tokenizer and an parser for the toy language using java regex library. The project is able to analyze, report syntax errors, report unitialized variables and do computations.
